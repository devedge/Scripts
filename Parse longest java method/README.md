# Parse longest java method

This script parses all of the java files in a directory and its subdirectories
to find the longest method

To use, run `python find_longest_java_method.py` and specify an absolute path to a folder to search. The Java file with the longest method will be printed out to the console (full pathname), the number of lines it spans, and the number of Java files were searched.
