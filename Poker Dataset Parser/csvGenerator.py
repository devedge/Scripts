 
# ask for a directory to scan (recursive?)

# for every file in the directory, call datafileParser.py

# after each game datafileParser.py finishes, it calls a method here.
# the method here receives the gameArray. 
# using the methods in parserAPI.py, it retrieves the requested data and 
#   saves it in a csv file

# the gameArray array has all of the necessary data from every game




# (what if instead of returning each game, it returned an array of all of the games?)
