 
# ask for a directory to scan (recursive?)

# pass the directory to parserAPI.py

# in parserAPI.py, after each file parsed, 
#   call a method here for storing the array results in a csv file

# the method here for creating the csv file can call helper methods
#   from parserAPI.py to get relevant data


# all that has to be changed here is how the data will explicitly be
#   saved in the csv file
