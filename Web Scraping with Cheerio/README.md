## About

A NodeJS script that scrapes twitter using Cheerio. Currently only extracts follower count, but more will be added.
<br><br>

## Setup

After unzipping [the file](https://github.com/devedge/Scripts/raw/master/Web%20Scraping%20with%20Cheerio/data/Scraper.zip), install dependencies with:

`$ npm install`

<br>

The script runs with:
`$ node scrape.js`
The twitter @ username currently needs to be manually inserted in scrape.js

<br>

## TODO

Add a list of current browser user agents to github, and have the scraper use them while scraping twitter.
